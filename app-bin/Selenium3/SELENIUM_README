Internet Explorer 10
--------------------
- On IE 7 or higher on Windows Vista or Windows 7, you must set the Protected Mode settings for each zone to be the same value.
The value can be on or off, as long as it is the same for every zone. To set the Protected Mode settings, choose "Internet Options..."
from the Tools menu, and click on the Security tab. For each zone, there will be a check box at the bottom 
of the tab labeled "Enable Protected Mode".

- The browser zoom level must be set to 100% so that the native mouse events can be set to the correct coordinates.


Internet Explorer 11
-------------------
- The browser zoom level must be set to 100% so that the native mouse events can be set to the correct coordinates.

- Additionally, "Enhanced Protected Mode" must be disabled for IE 10 and higher.
This option is found in the Advanced tab of the Internet Options dialog.

- Manually adding the domain of the site (or sites) under test to the list of Trusted Sites in IE11

- For IE 11 only, you will need to set a registry entry on the target computer so that the driver can maintain a connection 
to the instance of Internet Explorer it creates. For 32-bit Windows installations, the key you must examine in the 
registry editor is HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BFCACHE. 
For 64-bit Windows installations, the key is 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BFCACHE. 
Please note that the FEATURE_BFCACHE subkey may or may not be present, and should be created if it is not present. 
Important: Inside this key, create a DWORD value named iexplore.exe with the value of 0.
